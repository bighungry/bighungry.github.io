<p>It was late Thursday night and after a somewhat harrowing cab ride (that took over an hour to go just 12 miles), we dropped our bags off in our room (where it was 59 degrees even though the thermostat was set to 77) and ran into Paris in the hallway. She asked if we wanted a drink or food, and drinks were definitely called for after that cab ride, so we headed out into the cold and walked down Frenchmen Street.</p>
<p>There was live music coming out of nearly every restaurant and club, regardless of how many people were inside and there weren't many. But the music in New Orleans happens with or without people and that's a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>We stepped into Cafe Negril, one of the many legendary music venues. In other cities where you'd see parking spaces everywhere, that's what legendary music venues are like in New Orleans.</p>
<p>There was a band setting up and projected on the wall was an absolutely kickass early 90s hip-hop playlist from YouTube: Soul II Soul, Fugees, Big Pun, OutKast...you get the idea.</p>
<p>Paris told us that Zena Moses, the singer about to go on, was going to rock our worlds so we better get our drinks in hand, and passed me two free drink cards courtesy of her B&B. Cafe Negril has signature mixed drinks that are named after their favorite performers.</p>
<p>The crowd was mostly made up of wedding guests, and someone mentioned to Zena that Paris and Jack were getting married the very next day, so she called them up front and center and dedicated her next song to the happy couple: Pony by Ginuwine, and after absolutely rocking that, she then flawlessly transitioned into Freak Like Me by Adina Howard wihtout missing a beat. My jaw was on the floor.</p>
